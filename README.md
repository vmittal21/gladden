Inspiration - Every person is stressed in some situation or the other. This application tries to make one feel calm and happy and increase their productivity and overall brain health

What it does - Checks with user about their mood. Categorizes them into happy, sad or angry. If the user is already happy, they try to make them happier and tell them to keep up the good mood. If the user is sad, it tries to make them happy by providing comical gifs. If they are angry, it tries to calm them down.

How I built it - I used Alexa developer console to interact with the user. For the backend, I used python and json. for gifs, we use giffy and for music to be converted to waveform, we use https://www.renderforest.com/

What's next for Gladden - build a songs' library that categorizes songs on the basis of user emotion and then provide output in form of video beats with lots of colours. The colours should also be categorized on the emotion input, like for example, light colours to calm down the user if they are angry and bright colours if they are feeling sad.
